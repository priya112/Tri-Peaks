        TRI-PEAKS RULES:
        ----------------
        The object of Tri-Peaks is to transfer all the cards from the board
        to the heap.

        You can move a card from the board that has a value one lower or
        higher than the top card on the heap if it is not covered by
        another card.

        If you run out of moves you can move a card from the deck to the
        heap and try again to move a card from the board.
        
        How to play:
            Write "draw" to draw a card from the deck
            Write "move H7" to move H7 from board to heap
            Write "help" to view this message
            Write "top5" to view the highscore table
